# Common Troubleshooting

- If the loader keeps restarting the user, manually disable exploit protection
- When you login, spoofer is automatically turned off, you have to click the spoof hwid, and then load
- Uninstall: vanguard/faceit/vmware/processhacker
- If the loader prompts an error starting with C4D, it is a network error, use a VPN, if the error starts with E00D, it is security Error(refer to the uninstall list)
- Invalid hwid = self explanatory
- Authentication failed = wrong user/pw
- If loader closing on login --> date and time --> sync clock
